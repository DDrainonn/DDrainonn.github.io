										<h2>Math At Compass</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Math at Compass, I belive, is the least different from a normal math class at a normal school. However, I have the ability to use a computer to research any problem or worksheet I'm having touble on so I almost never have trouble with math. Other than that the projects are probably the factor that makes Compass math class different.   </p>

												<h3>The Dartboard Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The objective of the dart board project was to learn a little about probability as well as seeing how area and point systems work. We were tasked to build a dart board out of geometric shapes then we had to calculate the probability that a dart thrown would hit the different shapes. Based on this information we had then had to assign points to each shape on the dart board. The end product was us taking our dart boards to class and letting people throw darts at it for a while.</p>

												<h3>Watering The Lawn Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For this project we were told to set up a pattern of of sprinklers to water a lawn in the most efficient pattern. We had to find the area of a lawn choosen from google earth and figure out how many sprinklers could fit in the lwan without overlapping. The lawn had to be a complex shape with diagonals and curves. We were not alowed to use square lawns in this project. This project was farely easy and didn't take too much effort. </p>

												<h3>Physics Project</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For this project we had to enter into at least 2 of the ISU stem day science challenges. My team which was just me and one other person picked to do the mouse trap powered car and the tennis ball catapult. When we arrived at the ISU stem day competition we race the car and launched the catapult. We ended up getting first in the mouse trap car and got 3rd in the catapult competition. This by far was the most fun I've ever had doing math.</p>
